# Overview
CM-Ecommerce is meant to be a full-stack ecommerce site where users can perform
CRUD operations on products, customers can browse products put up, and (without
signing in) customers can add products to a cart and pay for them via a credit
card. While I'm not going to be documenting everything in this README (for now,
and probably forever), I'm going to keep a dev diary [here](https://dot-education-70e.notion.site/CM-Ecommerce-578e3cc83a9b409f8a57694effb5ff7f).

# Current Goals
[ ] Set up user routes in GraphQL (API)
    [ ] Specifically, login, register, and me routes
[ ] Set up login page
    - Later, this should be separate pages. One for seller login, and another
      for customer login
[ ] Set up kanban board for user stories
