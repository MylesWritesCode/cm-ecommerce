# Overview
CM-Ecommerce is meant to be a full-stack ecommerce site where users can perform
CRUD operations on products, customers can browse products put up, and (without
signing in) customers can add products to a cart and pay for them via a credit
card. While I'm not going to be documenting everything in this README (for now,
and probably forever), I'm going to keep a dev diary [here](https://dot-education-70e.notion.site/CM-Ecommerce-578e3cc83a9b409f8a57694effb5ff7f).
